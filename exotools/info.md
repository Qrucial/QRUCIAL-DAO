## This folder is meant to be used for the docker parts of QDAO, eg. ExoTools

## ExoTool 1. --> cargo audit --json
Requirements include the source file and Cargo.toml + dict structure

If this is a smart contract, it should be pretty easy to be definable


## ExoTool Docker image requestements
Use of "docker exec" || linked folder where we have the files of the audit requestor / shared FS
