QRUCIAL DAO is a next generation security toolsuite and reputation system for web3 security.

## üí° High Level Summary:
Built on top of Substrate, Qrucial DAO is a system for transparent audits and certifications, issuing non-transferable NFTs to the audited systems themselves.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Tool execution flow: 
Audit request on front-end &#9658; Validation and hash verification of project package &#9658; Listing in QDAO state &#9658; Event triggers ExoTool (automated execution started) &#9658; Manual audit by auditor &#9658; Reporting &#9658; Reports are open to be challenges

## üå± Philosophy:

We believe that audits should be transparent and trustless.
