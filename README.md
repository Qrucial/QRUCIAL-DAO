QRUCIAL-DAO is a next generation security toolsuite for blockchain security.

## üí° High Level Summary:
Built on top of Substrate, Qrucial DAO is a system for transparent audits and certifications, issuing non-transferable NFTs to the audited systems themselves.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Tool execution flow: 
Signed extrinsic incoming &#9658; Verification &#9658; Listing in QDAO State &#9658; Event triggered (exosys reads JSON RPC) &#9658; Execution and result output &#9658; ExoSys Extrinsic &#9658; Aggregate and verify restuls &#9658; Report delivery (encrypted)

## üå± Philosophy:

We believe that audits should be transparent and trustless.
