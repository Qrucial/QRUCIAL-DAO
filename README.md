QRUCIAL DAO is a web3 security toolsuite and reputation system. Use node-setup.sh to install and to update full nodes. Currently the project is in beta mode.

## üí° High Level Summary:
Built on top of Substrate, Qrucial DAO is a transparent security audit and auditor reputation system, issuing non-transferable NFTs to the audited systems themselves. We are running most of the login on-chain and execute tools off-chain.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Live testnet
You can see and test a live, beta full-node on [Qrucial.io](https://qrucial.io/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Tool execution flow: 
Audit request on front-end &#9658; Validation and hash verification of project package &#9658; Listing in QDAO state &#9658; Event triggers ExoTool (automated execution started) &#9658; Manual audit by auditor &#9658; Reporting &#9658; Reports are open to be challenges

## üå± Philosophy:

We believe that audits should be transparent and trustless.
