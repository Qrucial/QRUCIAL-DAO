# üí° High level summary
This pallet handles the sign up as well as the reputation of auditors.


# ‚öôÔ∏è  Auditrep execution Flow
## New auditor signup
1. New user requests auditor status, the auditor provides as part of the request some profile information about him in markdown format(extrinsic receives a hash of it). As long as the auditor is not approved, his/her reputation score is `None`. The user must stake and amount of `$AUDITOR_STAKE` tokens in order to request and mantain the auditor status. 
2. 3 Author's with auditor status and a reputation score above `$APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` approve the auditor request.
3. The 3.rd approval assigns the auditor an initial reputation score `$INIT_SCORE`.
4. The user can always cancel the approval process and claim back his `$AUDITOR_STAKE` amount of tokens then.
